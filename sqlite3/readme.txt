BUILDING A NEW VERSION
----------------------



Sqlite3 built as follows:

1. Download new amalgamated source code from https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

2. Unzip the file

3. Copy the following files to the mushclient source "sqlite3" directory:

sqlite3.c
sqlite3.h
sqlite3ext.h

4. If you get compile errors like C2059 'bad suffix on number' on older compilers, remove the LL suffix from constants.
For example, change:

    && i >= -2251799813685248LL && i < 2251799813685248LL);

to:

    && i >= -2251799813685248 && i < 2251799813685248);

This currently happens on four lines in the source in sqlite3.c.
(Visual Studio 6.0 uses a suffix of i64 or ui64 instead of LL or ULL).
